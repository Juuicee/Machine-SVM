Instructions to run the SVM model -

- If possible run the program on colab.research.google.com

- Click file and upload the .ipynb file that is in this zip file

- Click on the side bar and go to the files section
  - upload the dataset twitchdata.csv file

Install the following pipes :

!pip install sklearn
!pip install pandas
!pip install numpy

Once you have all of this you can run the code freely

* OUTPUT FOR THE ACCURACY, PRECISION, RECALL AND RUNTIME ARE ALL BELOW THE SORTED LIST OF STREAMERS. *

*TAKE NOTE IT WILL TAKE AROUND 60-70 SECONDS OF RUNTIME*

ALL ARE LINKS TO THE MODULES FOR THE LIBRARIES THAT WE HAD USED.

EXTRA OUTPUTS YOU CAN GET : 

IF U CHANGE THE LINK OF CODE -> svm_model = SVC(kernel = 'linear')
U ARE ABLE TO CHANGE THE KERNEL LINEAR INTO poly, sigmoid, and rbf
-- LINEAR HAS THE BEST ACCURACY!
